# Hi! so this is the picture of the first site live on github pages!

https://staycold.github.io/Code_Refactor/

## What the goal was/What I did.
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## I hope you enjoy!
